### Best-First Scheduler

#### Why use?

picking out college classes is a PITA. The classes that you want often overlap, are full, or start too early or too late (I'm looking at you, CSCI 2275). In addition, many core classes often have issues with limited space, so it's important to know exactly what classes and timeslots you're signing up for beforehand. This automatic scheduler uses patented blockchain AI technology to automatically generate class schedules for you.
