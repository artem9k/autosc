#### Why use?

picking out college classes is a PITA. The classes that you want often overlap, are full, or start too early or too late (I'm looking at you, CSCI 2275). In addition, many core classes often have issues with limited space, so it's important to know exactly what classes and timeslots you're signing up for beforehand. Luckily, scheduling things with constraints is one of those rare tasks that computers outperform humans at using vanilla algorithms. This program will help you make the perfect college scheduler 100% guaranteed no scamerino
